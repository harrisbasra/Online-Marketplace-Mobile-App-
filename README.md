# Online-Marketplace-Mobile-App-
An Online Marketplace where people can rent things online with an intergrated Messanger in it which can do video call, voice call, and capture-to-send things as well in addition to the chatting. You can add offers to the already live products and this will notify the interested users by push notifications.

# Development
This is developed by using React Native Development (Java Script) with firebase connected to store data. 
It is the design copy of following figma file (https://www.figma.com/file/WXrVVwe8AVLKO50dYlgsFb/Renting-App---NASCON?node-id=0%3A1&amp;t=Z43LOL7YCfh0TOkr-1)
(Figma file is not owned by me and still remains a property of NasCon)

# Coding
The Design is converted into code by using the Figma Extension "Locofy". And then code is written against it.
